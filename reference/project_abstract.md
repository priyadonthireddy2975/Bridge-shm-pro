## 📄 Abstract

### Problem Statement
To measure how a bridge reacts with respect to time in the form of vibration RMS and frequency values while having different load on it, and to get the detailed analysis of bridge safety regarding its stiffness and behavior changes.

### Project Description
This project focuses on the measurement of bridge vibrations through different forms by using **ADXL335 three-directional sensors** and an **ESP32 microcontroller** to convert raw ADC readings into meaningful digital values. 

In this project, we measure how a bridge actually reacts **with and without load** over time, which indirectly describes the structural condition of the bridge in the form of behavioral changes (stiffness/damping).

### Scope
This working model helps to:
1. Understand the behavioral changes of a bridge over time.
2. Predict the outcome or potential destruction of the bridge **before an accident occurs**.

### Future Aspects
This project and overall model help engineers to:
1. Get in-hand data on mobile devices.
2. Prepare for maintenance **before** any incident occurs.
